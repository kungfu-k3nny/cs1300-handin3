        <p>I ran a simple A/B test on two different UI designs and analyzed the results. From these results, we drew conclusions on whether a design choice could have reasonably impacted user interaction.</p>

        <h2>Part 2: Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Creating Hypotheses</h3>
        <p>There are three metrics that we are using to determine whether or not
            my design choices reasonably impacted user interaction: Time spent on
            page, misclick rate, and total distance of cursor movement. Below, I
            dive into the details of why I used these metrics, the null
            and alternative hypotheses for each of the metrics, and the reasoning
            behind choosing these hypotheses.</p>
        <ol>
            <h4><li>Time spent on page</li></h4>
            <p>More time spent on the page indicates a user confusion</p>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>The null hypothesis is that users spend the same amount of 
                    time on webpage A as they spend on webpage B</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>

        <h2>Part 1: Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>I will be conducting a competitve analysis for the websites of Netflix,
          Instagram, and Gmail:</p>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>Netflix's strongest factor was that as soon as you open it, a film is already
            playing based on your preferences. Since it is difficult for the user to know
            if they will like a film or not, it is good that netflix sorts films by revelance
            to the user. The drawback of this suggested film feature is poor navigation scent.
            With the whole window being the suggested film, there is no obvious conceptual model
            for how to navigate the website. Netflix's weakest factor is probably that you
            cannot sort films by studio. Some people are fans of certain film studios, so
            having the option to see films by a particular studio would be beneficial.
          </p>
          <p>Instagram's strongest factor was that the content is by default sorted from top to
            bottom based on on
            interest to the user, and also based on recency. This instills a strong
            navigational scent,
            since users know that the next content that comes up is likely to pique their
            interest. Instagram's biggest weakness is it's inability to search content by title.
            By nature of the content, which typically is too casual and numerous to warrant
            unique titles, this does make sense, but it means that most information is either
            searched through the producer, or fed by the company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gmail's strongest factor was it's strict sorting of content by recency. This makes
            it easy for users to find emails just by knowing when they were sent. Like instagram,
            The fact that emails continued downwards until it moved off screen made for a good
            navigation scent, since it shows that there are more, older emails below. Gmail's
            biggest weakness is that the user cannot sort emails by relevance. This is not terrible
            since the use of gmail is more for record purposes rather than entertainment purposes.
          </p>

          <p>The features I want to implement are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Filtering content with a search bar</li>
            <p>This can be done by adding a text box where items in the aggregator
              are temporarily removed if the text in the text box do not match with
              any text in the content
            </p>
            <li>Filtering content by producer</li>
            <p>This can be done in conjunction with the search bar. Simply add
              the producer as another text to match the text in the search bar with
            </p>
          </ol>
    </section>

      <h2>Part 2: Creating the React App</h2>
      <p>I chose to create a fantasy sports website since I use them pretty often and a lot of
        their functionality relies on their favoriting function. Filtering is incorporated through
        The buttons on the top of the screen that selects either NBA or LOL player props, and the 2
        buttons underneath filter for what category of player props are shown. Sorting is incorporated
        through the sort by drop down menu, which sorts the props by game time or popularity. Lastly,
        the props are aggregated on the right side of the screen, where users can remove props that
        they have changed their minds about.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app is run using Vercel, and can be found here:

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>I was able to add features to the fantasy sports site inspired by the competitive
          analysis like sorting by recency, as well as filtering by category (like how netflix sorts
          their movies and tv shows in different categories).
          With more time, I would like to add search functionality, as that was one of the best
          features I discovered from the competitive analysis.
